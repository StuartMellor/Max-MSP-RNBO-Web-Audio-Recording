# Max-MSP-RNBO-Web-React-Simple-FM
A very simple FM Synth with a single modulator and carrier with a library of custom SVG-based components.

The overall aim of the project is to explore the integration of max into a "ERN" framework (Express, React and NodeJS).

Specific Goals:
- Create Sliders, Dials, Buttons (Triggers) and Switches (25% complete).
- Create Meters and Graphs (0% complete).
- Automate Interface Generation (0% complete).
